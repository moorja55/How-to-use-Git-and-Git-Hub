Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A: It helped me narrow down my search and only focus on the differences between the versions so I
 	could easily find the typo.

Q: How could having easy accces to  the entire history of a file make you a more efficent programmer in the long term?
A: When an error ecors I could just qucikly look back at my previous code to what I have changed then either find the 
	differnece or just start back at the old edition again.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having  
	versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A: Pros each section makes sense and runnable. Cons: User errors ecors such as version size.

Q:Why do you think some version control systems, like Git allow saving multiple files in one commit,
	while others, like Google Docs, treat each file sepatatley?
A: Git allows saving multiple files in one commit since it was designed for coding, and coding requires
	multiple files for one program. Google Docs does not save multiple files for version control since
	it was designed for casual writing which does not need multiple file version control.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: Use gitt diff to find the two versions I want to find then I use gitt diff to compare those two 
	commit's differences.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
	something?
A: Using version control would make me feel more confident to make changes that could break
	my code since if I do break my code I can just go back to a previous version and diagnose what
	is wrong.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A: I want to try using Git on my Anitums Game.
